## Description

With air travel demand recovering to pre-pandemic levels, more passengers are deciding where to travel and which airline to travel with. This project will examine hundreds of reviews for the best-rated airlines according to Skytrax's 2023 World Airline Award and identify the factors that distinguish these airlines. By analyzing passenger sentiment, demographic differences, and flight aspects that most significantly influence passenger experience, we aim to provide insight into the key factors of customer satisfaction. By identifying factors that contribute the most to customer satisfaction, airlines can strategically focus their resources on the appropriate, high-impact areas and optimize the return from these investments.
